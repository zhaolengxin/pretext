# Research Log

Everything we tried, measured, and learned while building this library.

## The problem: DOM measurement interleaving

When UI components independently measure text heights (e.g. virtual scrolling a comment feed), each `getBoundingClientRect()` forces synchronous layout reflow. If components write DOM then read measurements without coordination, the browser re-layouts on every read. For 500 comments, this can cost 30ms+ per frame.

The goal: measure text heights without any DOM reads, so components can measure independently without coordinating batched passes.

## Approach 1: Canvas measureText + word-width caching

Canvas `measureText()` bypasses the DOM layout engine entirely. It goes straight to the browser's font engine. No reflow, no interleaving.

Two-phase design:
- `prepare(text, font)` — segment text, measure each word via canvas, cache widths
- `layout(prepared, maxWidth)` — walk cached widths, count lines. Pure arithmetic.

On resize (width changes), only `layout()` runs. No canvas calls, no DOM, no strings. ~0.0002ms per text block.

### Benchmarks (500 comments, resize to new width)

| Approach | Chrome | Safari |
|---|---|---|
| Our library | 0.02ms | 0.02ms |
| DOM batch (best case) | 0.18ms | 0.14ms |
| DOM interleaved | ~same (hidden container) | ~same |
| Sebastian's text-layout (no cache) | 30ms | 31ms |
| Sebastian's + word cache added | 3.8ms | 2.7ms |

Sebastian's 30ms breakdown:
- Chrome: createRunList 8.4ms (bidi + break iterator) + breakLine 20ms (canvas measureText per run)
- Safari: createRunList 1ms + breakLine 27ms
- The measurement calls dominate. Word-width caching eliminates them on resize.

CJK scaling: prepare() cost scales linearly with segment count (~1 segment per CJK character vs ~1 per word for Latin). See `/benchmark` page for live numbers.

## Approach 2 (rejected): Full-line measureText in layout

Instead of summing cached word widths, measure the full candidate line as a single string during layout. Should be pixel-perfect since it captures inter-word kerning.

Results:
- Chrome: 27ms for 500 comments. Safari: 136ms.
- **Worse than Sebastian's original.**
- The cost is O(n²) string concatenation: `lineStr + word` copies the entire line on every word.
- Actually **less accurate** than word-by-word (196/208 vs 202/208 match against DOM).

The string concatenation dominates. Not viable.

## Approach 3 (rejected): DOM-based measurement in prepare()

Replace canvas `measureText()` with hidden `<span>` elements in `prepare()`. Create spans for all words, read widths in one batch (one reflow), cache them. Layout stays arithmetic.

Results:
- Accuracy: fixes the system-ui font mismatch (see below). 99.2% → matches DOM exactly for named fonts.
- Problem: **reintroduces DOM reads**. Each `prepare()` call triggers a reflow. If components call `prepare()` independently during a render cycle, we're back to interleaving.

This defeats the purpose. Reverted.

## Approach 4 (rejected): SVG getComputedTextLength()

SVG `<text>` has `getComputedTextLength()` for single-line width measurement. But:
- Still a DOM read (triggers layout)
- No auto-wrapping (SVG text is single-line)
- Strictly worse than canvas for our use case

## Discovery: system-ui font resolution mismatch

Canvas and DOM resolve `system-ui` to different font variants on macOS at certain sizes:

| Size | Canvas/DOM match |
|---|---|
| 10px | MISMATCH (2.9%) |
| 11px | MISMATCH (6.9%) |
| 12px | MISMATCH (11.3%) |
| 13px | OK |
| 14px | MISMATCH (14.5%) |
| 15-25px | OK |
| 26px | MISMATCH (12.4%) |
| 27-28px | OK |

macOS uses SF Pro Text (small sizes) and SF Pro Display (large sizes). Canvas and DOM switch between them at different thresholds.

**Fix: use a named font** (Helvetica Neue, Inter, Arial, etc.). With named fonts, canvas and DOM agree perfectly (0.00px diff).

## Discovery: word-by-word sum accuracy

Tested whether `measureText("word1") + measureText(" ") + measureText("word2")` equals `measureText("word1 word2")` in canvas:

**Diff: 0.0000152587890625px.** Essentially zero for two-word pairs. Canvas `measureText()` is internally consistent — no kerning/shaping across word boundaries.

The same test with HarfBuzz: also 0.00 diff (when using explicit LTR direction).

However, over full paragraphs (20+ segments), the per-pair consistency doesn't guarantee cumulative accuracy. The word-by-word sum of a full text can diverge from `measureText(fullText)` by 1-3px, enough to cause off-by-one line breaks at borderline widths. This affects ~2 tests on Chrome (Georgia) and ~11 on Safari (emoji-heavy text). Two approaches were tried and reverted:

- **Trailing space exclusion**: exclude trailing space width from overflow check. Logically sound (CSS trailing spaces hang) but too disruptive — changed break decisions across the board (99.9% → 95%).
- **Uniform scaling**: measure full text, compute ratio vs word-sum, scale all segment widths. Overcorrects some segments and undercorrects others since the divergence isn't uniformly distributed (99.9% → 99.7%).

- **Character-level + pair kerning** (inspired by [uWrap](https://github.com/leeoniya/uWrap)): measure per-character with uppercase pair kerning LUT instead of per-word. Reduces per-step rounding error but loses the per-word shaping accuracy that Chrome's canvas provides. Chrome 99.9% → 99.7%. The error goes in opposite directions by browser — Chrome's word-level sum runs slightly wide, Safari's runs slightly narrow — so no single measurement granularity wins everywhere.

- **Hybrid verify**: store segment texts, run word-sum layout, verify borderline lines (within 5px of maxWidth) with a full-string `measureText` call. Problem: our emoji correction makes the word-sum MORE accurate than raw `measureText`. The verification uses uncorrected full-string measurement, which reintroduces emoji inflation errors. Result: Chrome 99.9% → 99.8%. To work, the verifier would need to replicate the emoji correction pipeline on the reconstructed string — defeating the simplicity goal.

The divergence is small and varies by character adjacency — it's not a constant bias. The core difficulty: our corrections (emoji, kinsoku, punctuation merging) make the word-sum *more* accurate than raw canvas for those specific cases. Any verification against raw `measureText` fights the corrections. A correct verifier would need the same correction pipeline applied to full-string measurements, which adds complexity for marginal gain. There may be a better approach we haven't found yet.

## Prior art

- **[uWrap](https://github.com/leeoniya/uWrap)** (Leon Sorokin) — <2KB, character-pair kerning LUT for virtual scroll height prediction. 10x faster than canvas-hypertxt. Latin-only (no CJK/bidi/emoji). Measures character pairs instead of words, which avoids cumulative word-sum error but misses per-word shaping.
- **[canvas-hypertxt](https://github.com/glideapps/canvas-hypertxt)** (Glide) — trains a weighting model to estimate string widths without measureText after warmup. ~200K weekly npm downloads.
- **[chenglou/text-layout](https://github.com/chenglou/text-layout)** — Sebastian Markbage's original prototype. Canvas measureText + bidi from pdf.js. No caching, no Intl.Segmenter. Our direct ancestor.
- **[tex-linebreak](https://github.com/robertknight/tex-linebreak)** — Knuth-Plass optimal line breaking. Quality over speed, not for DOM height prediction.
- **[linebreak](https://github.com/foliojs/linebreak)** (foliojs) — UAX #14 Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Used by PDFKit, Sebastian's original.

## Discovery: punctuation accumulation error

At larger font sizes, measuring segments separately accumulates error:
- `measureText("better") + measureText(".")` can differ from `measureText("better.")` by up to 2.6px at 28px font.
- Over a full line of segments, this pushes the total 2-3px past what the browser renders.
- At borderline widths, this causes off-by-one line breaks.

**Fix: merge punctuation into preceding word** before measuring. `Intl.Segmenter` produces `["better", "."]` as separate segments. We merge non-space, non-word segments into the preceding word: `["better."]`. Measured as one unit.

This also matches CSS behavior where punctuation is visually attached to its word.

## Discovery: trailing whitespace CSS behavior

CSS `white-space: normal` lets trailing spaces "hang" past the line edge — they don't contribute to the line width for breaking purposes. Our initial algorithm counted space widths in the line total, causing premature breaks at narrow widths.

**Fix: when a space segment causes overflow, skip it** (don't break, don't add to lineW). This matches the CSS behavior: trailing spaces hang.

## Discovery: emoji canvas/DOM width discrepancy

Canvas and DOM measure emoji at different widths on macOS (Chrome):

| Size | Canvas | DOM | Diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10px | 13px | 11px | +2 |
| 12px | 15px | 12px | +3 |
| 14px | 18px | 14px | +4 |
| 15px | 19px | 15px | +4 |
| 16px | 20px | 16px | +4 |
| 20px | 22px | 20px | +2 |
| 24px | 24px | 24px | 0 |
| 28px+ | matches | matches | 0 |

Properties:
- Same across all font families — verified across 7 fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman, Verdana, Courier New, Trebuchet MS). The diff is identical for every font at every size.
- Same for all emoji types tested (59 emoji: simple, ZWJ sequences, flags, skin tones, keycaps)
- Additive per emoji grapheme: "👏👏👏" diff = 3 × single diff
- DOM scales linearly: emoji width = font size (for ≥12px)
- Canvas inflates at small sizes, converges at ≥24px
- CSS line-breaking uses the DOM (visual) width, not the inflated canvas width
- This is a Chrome/macOS issue with Apple Color Emoji rendering pipeline

Complete correction table (all integer sizes):

| Size | Canvas | DOM | Diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10px | 13px | 11px | +2 |
| 11px | 14px | 11.5px | +2.5 |
| 12px | 15px | 12px | +3 |
| 13px | 16px | 13px | +3 |
| 14px | 18px | 14px | +4 |
| 15px | 19px | 15px | +4 |
| 16px | 20px | 16px | +4 |
| 17px | 21px | 17px | +4 |
| 18px | 21px | 18px | +3 |
| 19px | 22px | 19px | +3 |
| 20px | 22px | 20px | +2 |
| 21px | 23px | 21px | +2 |
| 22px | 23px | 22px | +1 |
| 23px | 24px | 23px | +1 |
| 24px+ | matches | matches | 0 |

**Fix implemented**: auto-detect by comparing canvas emoji width vs actual DOM emoji width (one DOM measurement per font, cached). Safari renders emoji wider than fontSize at small sizes but canvas and DOM agree — so no correction needed there. The original approach (canvas vs fontSize) over-corrected on Safari.

## Discovery: HarfBuzz guessSegmentProperties RTL bug

When running headless tests with HarfBuzz, `buf.guessSegmentProperties()` assigns RTL direction to isolated Arabic words. This changes their advance widths compared to measuring them as part of a mixed LTR/RTL string:

- `measure("مستندات")` isolated with RTL: 51.35px
- Same word in `measure("your مستندات with")`: effective width is 74.34px
- Diff: 23px per Arabic word

**Fix: `buf.setDirection('ltr')` explicitly.** This matches browser canvas behavior where `measureText()` always returns the same width regardless of surrounding context. Result: 98.4% → 100% accuracy.

Note: this is a headless testing issue only. Browser canvas is not affected.

## Server-side measurement comparison

Tested three server-side engines:

| Engine | Latin | CJK | Emoji | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @napi-rs/canvas | OK | Wrong (fallback widths) | Wrong (0.5x or 1x font size) | Needs explicit font registration |
| opentype.js | OK | OK (with CJK font) | OK (= font size) | Pure JS, no shaping |
| harfbuzzjs | OK | OK (with CJK font) | OK (= font size) | WASM, full shaping |

opentype.js and harfbuzzjs give identical results — both read advance widths from the font file directly. HarfBuzz additionally does shaping (ligatures, contextual forms) which matters for Arabic/Devanagari.

@napi-rs/canvas uses Skia but doesn't auto-detect macOS system fonts. CJK/emoji fall back to generic monospace widths without manual `GlobalFonts.registerFont()`.

None of these match browser canvas/DOM exactly — different font engines, different platform font resolution. Server-side measurement is useful for testing the algorithm but not for matching browser rendering.

## Safari CSS line-breaking differences

Safari's canvas and DOM agree on individual word widths (after trimming trailing spaces). But Safari's CSS engine breaks lines at different positions than our algorithm in three cases:

**1. Emoji break opportunities**

Safari breaks before emoji where we keep them on the current line:
- Ours: `"Great work! 👏👏👏"` on one line
- Safari: `"Great work! 👏👏"` then `"👏 This is..."` on next line

Safari treats emoji as break opportunities — you can break before an emoji even mid-phrase. Our algorithm only breaks before word-like segments (emoji are non-word in `Intl.Segmenter`), so emoji get attached to the preceding content.

**2. CJK kinsoku (line-start prohibition)**

Safari prohibits CJK punctuation (，。) from starting a new line:
- Ours: `"这是一段中文文本，"` (comma at end of line)
- Safari: `"这是一段中文文本"` then `"，用于测试..."` — wait, that puts comma at line start?

Actually Safari does the opposite: it keeps the comma with the NEXT line, pushing the preceding character to the next line too. This is the kinsoku shori rule — certain characters are prohibited from appearing at the start or end of a line. The browser rearranges break points to satisfy these constraints. Our grapheme-splitting treats every CJK character as an independent break point without kinsoku rules.

**3. Bidi boundary breaks**

Safari breaks differently around Arabic-Indic digits and mixed-script boundaries:
- Ours: `"The price is $42.99 (approximately ٤٢٫٩٩"` — Arabic digits on same line
- Safari: `"The price is $42.99 (approximately"` then `"٤٢٫٩٩ ريال..."` — breaks before Arabic digits

Safari's CSS engine may treat bidi script boundaries as preferred break points. Our algorithm doesn't consider script boundaries for break decisions.

**What we tried to fix Safari**

- **Trailing space exclusion from line width**: tracked space width separately, only counted it when followed by non-space. No effect on Safari accuracy, hurt Chrome (99.4% → 99.0%). Reverted.
- **Preventing punctuation merge into space segments**: stopped emoji/parens from merging with preceding space (which made them invisible to line breaking). Made Safari worse (48 → 56 mismatches). Reverted.

**Conclusion**: Safari's mismatches are CSS line-breaking rule differences, not measurement errors. Fixing them requires implementing kinsoku rules, emoji-as-break-point handling, and bidi-aware break preferences — CSS spec work beyond measurement.

## Accuracy summary

Browser (canvas measureText, named font):
- Chrome: 3837/3840 (99.9%) across 2 fonts × 8 sizes × 8 widths × 30 texts
  - Remaining 3 mismatches: 2 Georgia measurement rounding at borderline widths, 1 bidi boundary break
  - Emoji correction eliminated all 24 previous emoji mismatches
  - Kinsoku shori eliminated all 8 CJK line-breaking mismatches
- Safari: 3792/3840 (98.8%)
  - Remaining 48 mismatches: emoji breaks, CJK kinsoku, bidi boundaries (CSS rule differences)
- Firefox: untested at scale but has same emoji inflation as Chrome (worse: +5px at 15px vs Chrome's +4px, converges at 28px vs Chrome's 24px). Auto-correction should handle it.

Headless (HarfBuzz, Arial Unicode):
- 1472/1472 (100%) word-sum vs full-line measurement
- Algorithm is exact; browser mismatches are measurement backend differences

## What Sebastian already knew

From his RESEARCH file:
> "Space and tabs are used to define word boundaries. CJK characters are treated as individual words."
> "Spaces are shaped independently from the words."

He designed for per-word caching but never implemented it. His code re-measures every run on every `breakLine()` call. Adding a word-width cache to his library drops it from 30ms to 3ms — a 10x improvement from caching alone, without changing the algorithm.

We went further: the two-phase split (prepare once, layout as arithmetic) drops it to 0.02ms — a 1500x improvement over his original.
